## AirSim Drone Racing Lab: Overview
<img src="https://github.com/muralikarteek7/Drone_Vision_control/blob/main/images/race.gif?raw=true" width="400"> 

ADRL is a framework for drone racing research, built on [Microsoft AirSim](https://github.com/Microsoft/Airsim).   
We used our framework to host a simulation-based drone racing competition at NeurIPS 2019, [Game of Drones](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim-NeurIPS2019-Drone-Racing). 

Currently, ADRL allows you to focus on three core research directions pertinent to autonomous drone racing -  perception, trajectory planning and control, and head-tp-head competition with a single competitor drone.
